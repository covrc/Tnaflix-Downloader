# Tnaflix-Downloader
A command line video downloader created for tnaflix.com

```git clone https://github.com/covrc/Tnaflix-Downloader``` to copy repository.
After clonning repo run ```cd Tnaflix-Downloader ; pip install -r requirements.txt```

```python tnaflix.py -h``` for help
```python tnaflix.py URL -F``` to list formats.
```python tnaflix.py URL -f format``` to download specified format

I'm not able to commit changes everytime. So i will be happy if yt-dlp or any other project revize the code as their requirements and add this option to their project. This code works without errors now but I'm not sure it will always work.
